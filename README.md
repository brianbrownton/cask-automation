# cask-automation
Personal project for detecting new binaries for the folks at homebrew-cask

# usage
`$ python scan-parallel-url_sniff.py`

Should take about 400-500s (7-8m) with the default settings.

If there are casks you want ignored, add them to the `blacklist.txt` file. Just add the cask name, not the filename.
